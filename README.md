# email-harvester

## Description
When applying for an internship or job, we know the person but may not find his / her email address. We also do not want to communicate with the contact page on the blog page he wrote years ago. In this case, if the person we are going to contact is a developer and uses github, the email harvester will gather his email addresses by using his / her commits. So we can easily find out which email address he / she is using.

## Quick Start
```
npm run serve
```
